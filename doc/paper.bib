	abstract = {Permissioned blockchains are arising as a solution to federate companies prompting accountable interactions. A variety of consensus algorithms for such blockchains have been proposed, each of which has different benefits and drawbacks. Proof-of-Authority (PoA) is a new family of Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms largely used in practice to ensure better performance than traditional Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT). However, the lack of adequate analysis of PoA hinders any cautious evaluation of their effectiveness in real-world permissioned blockchains deployed over the Internet, hence on an eventually synchronous network experimenting Byzantine nodes.{\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}In this paper, we analyse two of the main PoA algorithms, named Aura and Clique, both in terms of provided guarantees and performances. First, we derive their functioning including how messages are exchanged, then we weight, by relying on the CAP theorem, consistency, availability and partition tolerance guarantees. We also report a qualitative latency analysis based on message rounds. The analysis advocates that PoA for per- missioned blockchains, deployed over the Internet with Byzantine nodes, do not provide adequate consistency guarantees for scenarios where data integrity is essential. We claim that PBFT can fit better such scenarios, despite a limited loss in terms of performance.}

ML algorithms have never been better promised while challenged by big data. Big data enables ML algorithms to uncover more fine-grained patterns and make more timely and accurate predictions than ever before; on the other hand, it presents major challenges to ML such as model scalability and distributed computing. In this paper, we introduce a framework of ML on big data (MLBiD) to guide the discussion of its opportunities and challenges. The framework is centered on ML which follows the phases of preprocessing, learning, and evaluation. In addition, the framework is also comprised of four other components, namely big data, user, domain, and system. The phases of ML and the components of MLBiD provide directions for identification of associated opportunities and challenges and open up future work in many unexplored or under explored research areas.}

	abstract = {Datasets from meteorological reanalyses and retrievals from satellites are the available sources of large-scale information about solar radiation. However, both the reanalyses and the satellite-based estimates can be severely biased, especially in high latitude regions. In this study, surface solar irradiance estimates from the ECMWF Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) and the Cloud, Albedo, Radiation dataset Edition 2 (CLARA-A2) were used as input to a random forest regression (RFR) model to construct a novel dataset with higher accuracy and precision than the input datasets. For daily averages of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) at Norwegian sites, CLARA-A2 and ERA5 respectively produced a root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of 17.9 Wm−2 and 27.1 Wm−2, a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 11.9 Wm−2 and 17.5 Wm−2, and a bias of −1.5 Wm−2 and 4.3 Wm−2. In contrast, the proposed regression model provided an RMSD of 16.2 Wm−2, an MAD of 10.8 Wm−2, and a bias of 0.0 Wm−2. This shows that the RFR model is both accurate and precise, and significantly reduces both dispersion and bias in the new dataset with respect to the constituent sources. A sky-stratification analysis was performed and it was found that the proposed model provides better estimates under all sky conditions with particular improvements in intermediate-cloudy conditions. The proposed regression model was also tested on five Swedish locations and it was found to improve surface solar irradiance estimates to a similar degree as for the Norwegian locations, thus proving its consistency under similar climatic conditions.}

	abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

	Abstract = {The separate but closely related topics of waveform estimation by filtering and information extraction by pattern recognition are covered in this review. Because of the low signal-to-noise ratio generally encountered in evoked potential research, a variety of filtering methods have been employed for improving waveform estimation. Initially the filtering was done with analog devices but with the availability of high performance minicomputers virtually all filtering is now done digitally. Filters of various types are considered. Among them are single and multiple channel Wiener filtering, Kalman filtering, minimum mean square error filtering, maximum signal-to-noise filtering, and several types of nonlinear filters. The application of adaptive filtering techniques is also considered. In recent years there has been a continual increase in the application of pattern recognition techniques to the processing of evoked potentials. The techniques are based on statistical decision theory and the underlying basis of these procedures is reviewed. The technique of linear stepwise discriminant analysis is considered as well as the use of general discriminant functions of linear and quadratic types. Applications of these procedures to psychophysiological testing are discussed with particular emphasis on auditory and visual event-related potentials.},

	Analysis of big data by machine learning offers considerable advantages for assimilation and evaluation of large amounts of complex health-care data. However, to effectively use machine learning tools in health care, several limitations must be addressed and key issues considered, such as its clinical implementation and ethics in health-care delivery. Advantages of machine learning include flexibility and scalability compared with traditional biostatistical methods, which makes it deployable for many tasks, such as risk stratification, diagnosis and classification, and survival predictions. Another advantage of machine learning algorithms is the ability to analyse diverse data types (eg, demographic data, laboratory findings, imaging data, and doctors' free-text notes) and incorporate them into predictions for disease risk, diagnosis, prognosis, and appropriate treatments. Despite these advantages, the application of machine learning in health-care delivery also presents unique challenges that require data pre-processing, model training, and refinement of the system with respect to the actual clinical problem. Also crucial are ethical considerations, which include medico-legal implications, doctors' understanding of machine learning tools, and data privacy and security. In this Review, we discuss some of the benefits and challenges of big data and machine learning in health care.}

	abstract={Proof-of-burn has been used as a mechanism to destroy cryptocurrency in a verifiable manner. Despite its well known use, the mechanism has not been previously formally studied as a primitive. In this paper, we put forth the first cryptographic definition of what a proof-of-burn protocol is. It consists of two functions: First, a function which generates a cryptocurrency address. When a user sends money to this address, the money is irrevocably destroyed. Second, a verification function which checks that an address is really unspendable. We propose the following properties for burn protocols. Unspendability, which mandates that an address which verifies correctly as a burn address cannot be used for spending; binding, which allows associating metadata with a particular burn; and uncensorability, which mandates that a burn address is indistinguishable from a regular cryptocurrency address. Our definition captures all previously known proof-of-burn protocols. Next, we design a novel construction for burning which is simple and flexible, making it compatible with all existing popular cryptocurrencies. We prove our scheme is secure in the Random Oracle model. We explore the application of destroying value in a legacy cryptocurrency to bootstrap a new one. The user burns coins in the source blockchain and subsequently creates a proof-of-burn, a short string proving that the burn took place, which she then submits to the destination blockchain to be rewarded with a corresponding amount. The user can use a standard wallet to conduct the burn without requiring specialized software, making our scheme user friendly. We propose burn verification mechanisms with different security guarantees, noting that the target blockchain miners do not necessarily need to monitor the source blockchain. Finally, we implement the verification of Bitcoin burns as an Ethereum smart contract and experimentally measure that the gas costs needed for verification are as low as standard Bitcoin transaction fees, illustrating that our scheme is practical.},

	abstract={As more applications are built on top of blockchain and public ledger, different approaches are developed to improve the performance of blockchain construction. Recently Intel proposed a new concept of proof-of-elapsed-time (PoET), which leverages trusted computing to enforce random waiting times for block construction. However, trusted computing component may not be perfect and 100{\%} reliable. It is not clear, to what extent, blockchain systems based on PoET can tolerate failures of trusted computing component. The current design of PoET lacks rigorous security analysis and a theoretical foundation for assessing its strength against such attacks. To fulfill this gap, we develop a theoretical framework for evaluating a PoET based blockchain system, and show that the current design is vulnerable in the sense that adversary can jeopardize the blockchain system by only compromising {\$}{\$}{\backslash}varTheta ({\backslash}log {\backslash}log n/{\backslash}log n){\$}{\$}fraction of the participating nodes, which is very small when n is relatively large. Based on our theoretical analysis, we also propose methods to mitigate these vulnerabilities.},

Stellar is a new global payment network that can directly transfer digital money anywhere in the world in seconds. The key innovation is a secure transaction mechanism across untrusted intermediaries, using a new Byzantine agreement protocol called SCP. With SCP, each institution specifies other institutions with which to remain in agreement; through the global interconnectedness of the financial system, the whole network then agrees on atomic transactions spanning arbitrary institutions, with no solvency or exchange-rate risk from intermediary asset issuers or market makers. We present SCP's model, protocol, and formal verification; describe the Stellar payment network; and finally evaluate Stellar empirically through benchmarks and our experience with several years of production use.},

	abstract = {Algorand is a new cryptocurrency that confirms transactions with latency on the order of a minute while scaling to many users. Algorand ensures that users never have divergent views of confirmed transactions, even if some of the users are malicious and the network is temporarily partitioned. In contrast, existing cryptocurrencies allow for temporary forks and therefore require a long time, on the order of an hour, to confirm transactions with high confidence.Algorand uses a new Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocol to reach consensus among users on the next set of transactions. To scale the consensus to many users, Algorand uses a novel mechanism based on Verifiable Random Functions that allows users to privately check whether they are selected to participate in the BA to agree on the next set of transactions, and to include a proof of their selection in their network messages. In Algorand's BA protocol, users do not keep any private state except for their private keys, which allows Algorand to replace participants immediately after they send a message. This mitigates targeted attacks on chosen participants after their identity is revealed.We implement Algorand and evaluate its performance on 1,000 EC2 virtual machines, simulating up to 500,000 users. Experimental results show that Algorand confirms transactions in under a minute, achieves 125x Bitcoin's throughput, and incurs almost no penalty for scaling to more users.},

	abstract = {Current segmented HTTP streaming systems provide scalable and quality adaptive video delivery services to a huge number of users. However, while they support a wide range of bandwidths and enable arbitrary content-based composition, their current formats have shortcomings like large overheads, live streaming delays, etc. We have therefore developed an adaptive media player that works around these problems while still using standard components like H.264/AVC for video, and MP3 for audio. The system's adaptivity allows the player to pick a quality level that makes good use of available bandwidth and CPU resources while at the same time maintaining smooth uninterrupted playback, as well as offering near instant seek and startup times.This paper presents an appropriate way of coding the segments and a simple multimedia container format that is optimized for adaptive streaming and video composition over HTTP. We show that our format is sufficiently advanced to contain any payload type, while being trivial to parse and translate to other container formats. Additionally, we show that our format is second to none in terms of overhead, without incurring any penalties on live streaming.},

Many attempts have been made to adjust and predict the fee volatility, but even well-formed transactions sometimes experience unexpected delays and evictions unless a substantial fee is offered. In this article, we propose a novel transaction inclusion model that describes the mechanisms and patterns governing miners decisions to include individual transactions in the Bitcoin system. Using this model we devise a Machine Learning (ML) approach to predict transaction inclusion. We evaluate our predictions method using historical observations of the Bitcoin network from a five month period that includes more than 30 million transactions and 120 million entries. We find that our Machine Learning (ML) model can predict fee volatility with an accuracy of up to 91%. Our findings enable Bitcoin users to improve their fee expenses and the approval time for their transactions.},

These studies typically produce large data sets that contain measurements on thousands of genes under hundreds of conditions. There is a critical need to summarize this data and to pick out the important details. The most common activities, therefore, are to group together microarray data and to reduce the number of features. Both of these activities can be done using only the raw microarray data (unsupervised methods) or using external information that provides labels for the microarray data (supervised methods). We briefly review supervised and unsupervised methods for grouping and reducing data in the context of a publicly available suite of tools called CLEAVER, and illustrate their application on a representative data set collected to study lymphoma.}

Traditional video monitoring systems may not be suitable due to limitations in the offshore fishing environment, including low bandwidth, unstable satellite network connections and issues of preserving the privacy of crew members. In this paper, we present &Aacute;ika, a robust system for executing distributed Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications on the edge. &Aacute;ika provides engineers and researchers with several building blocks in the form of Agents, which enable the expression of computation pipelines and distributed applications with robustness and privacy guarantees. Agents are continuously monitored by dedicated monitoring nodes, and provide applications with a distributed checkpointing and replication scheme. &Aacute;ika is designed for monitoring and surveillance in privacy-sensitive and unstable offshore environments, where flexible access policies at the storage level can provide privacy guarantees for data transfer and access.},

Little research has been conducted on predicting fluctuations in the price and number of transactions of a variety of cryptocurrencies. Moreover, the few methods proposed to predict fluctuation in currency prices are inefficient because they fail to take into account the differences in attributes between real currencies and cryptocurrencies. This paper analyzes user comments in online cryptocurrency communities to predict fluctuations in the prices of cryptocurrencies and the number of transactions. By focusing on three cryptocurrencies, each with a large market size and user base, this paper attempts to predict such fluctuations by using a simple and efficient method.},

	abstract = {Cloud services have turned remote computation into a commodity and enable convenient online collaboration. However, they require that clients fully trust the service provider in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Toward reducing this dependency, this article introduces VICOS, a protocol for verification of integrity and consistency for cloud object storage that enables a group of mutually trusting clients to detect data integrity and consistency violations for a cloud object storage service. It aims at services where multiple clients cooperate on data stored remotely on a potentially misbehaving service. VICOS enforces the consistency notion of fork-linearizability, supports wait-free client semantics for most operations, and reduces the computation and communication overhead compared to previous protocols. VICOS is based on a generic authenticated data structure. Moreover, its operations cover the hierarchical name space of a cloud object store, supporting a real-world interface and not only a simplistic abstraction. A prototype of VICOS that works with the key-value store interface of commodity cloud storage services has been implemented, and an evaluation demonstrates its advantage compared to existing systems.},

	abstract = {Despite the tremendous interest in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum today, many aspects of the underlying consensus protocols are poorly understood. Therefore, the search for protocols that improve either throughput or security (or both) continues. Bitcoin always selects the longest chain (i.e., the one with most work). Forks may occur when two miners extend the same block simultaneously, and the frequency of forks depends on how fast blocks are propagated in the network. In the GHOST protocol, used by Ethereum, all blocks involved in the fork contribute to the security. However, the greedy chain selection rule of GHOST does not consider the full information available in the block tree, which has led to some concerns about its security.This paper introduces a new family of protocols, called Medium, which takes the structure of the whole block tree into account, by weighting blocks differently according to their depths. Bitcoin and GHOST result as special cases. This protocol leads to new insights about the security of Bitcoin and GHOST and paves the way for developing network- and application-specific protocols, in which the influence of forks on the chain-selection process can be controlled. It is shown that almost all protocols in this family achieve strictly greater throughput than Bitcoin (at the same security level) and resist attacks that can be mounted against GHOST.},

We present a general approach to analyzing the robustness of equilibria to a small amount of incomplete information. A Nash equilibrium of a complete information game is said to be robust to incomplete information if every incomplete information game with payoffs almost always given by the complete information game has an equilibrium which generates behavior close to the Nash equilibrium. We show that many games with strict equilibria have no robust equilibrium and examine why we get such different results from existing refinements. If a game has a unique correlated equilibrium, it is robust. A natural many-player many-action generalization of risk dominance is a sufficient condition for robustness.},

Cross-validation is used to reconstruct 36 years of daily rainfall data at 17 gauges. Prediction is independent for each gauge. The reconstructed series are compared with the observed records in order to select the optimal hyperparameters within each family of models. The predictive performance of the models is evaluated using several metrics and statistics related with rainfall intensity and occurrence at daily, monthly and annual aggregation scales. Multivariate and univariate analysis of variance are used to evaluate the differences among models. The results of our work demonstrate that the performance of most machine learning models is very sensitive to the selected hyperparameters. Neural networks are found to perform best to predict rainfall occurrence and intensity. All methods underestimate the variance of the observed series at daily time scales. Generalized linear models using gamma-distributed errors perform best for predicting rainfall extremes, however, their performance limits its practical applications. Results improve significatively at larger temporal aggregations (monthly or annual) making statistical and machine learning methods more valuable for water resources studies.}

	abstract = {In recent years, cryptocurrency trades have increased dramatically, and this trend has attracted cyber-threat actors to exploit the existing vulnerabilities and infect their targets. The malicious actors use cryptocurrency malware to perform complex computational tasks using infected devices. Since cryptocurrency malware threats perform a legal process, it is a challenging task to detect this type of threat by a manual or heuristic method. In this paper, we propose a novel deep Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) learning model for hunting cryptocurrency malware threats. Specifically, our proposed model utilizes the RNN to analyze Windows applications’ operation codes (Opcodes) as a case study. We collect a real-world dataset that comprises of 500 cryptocurrency malware and 200 benign-ware samples, respectively. The proposed model trains with five different Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) structures and is evaluated by a 10-fold cross-validation (CV) technique. The obtained results prove that a 3-layer configuration model gains 98% of detection accuracy, which is the highest rate among other current configurations. We also applied traditional machine learning (ML) classifiers to show the applicability of deep learners (LSTM) versus traditional models in dealing with cryptocurrency malware.}
