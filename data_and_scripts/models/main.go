    types of players: Solo miners, Pool miners and industrial miners
    Solo miners: They mine on their own, they have to solve the block by themselves
    Pool miners: They mine in a pool, they share the reward with other miners
    Industrial miners: They have a lot of mining power, they mine a lot of blocks without the pool fees and reward splitting

    
    Exogenous properties(External):
    1. Bitcoin price 
    2. Mining difficulty 
    3. Transaction fees 
    4. Block reward 
    5. Electricity cost (not entirely exogenous as miners can choose where to mine)

    Endogenous properties(Internal):
    1. Hardware 
    2. Mining strategy 
    3 Operational efficiency


    Asumptions: 
    1. Miners immediately sell their rewards (dont factor for future value of BTC)
    2. Miners are rational and profit maximizing 
    3. Miners have imperfect information about the mining game
    4. Miners have access to the same technology and Hardware
    

    Simulate payouts based on the data in the spreadsheet (bitcoin_metrics_and_energy_updated_final_manually_scaled.xlsx)
    1. Calculate the daily revenue for each miner type 
    2. Calculate the daily cost for each miner type 
    3. Calculate the daily profit for each miner type
